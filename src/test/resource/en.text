Tom felt pleased to get a role for the school play. It was'n 16 role; after all, this ’ t a
was only his first year at high school. It just felt good to be in the play, even if he had only four or
five lines.
“ Do them in front of a mirror, ” his drama teacher had advised him. “ Watch how you loo
17 as often as you can. ” Tom did just that.
He worked and worked at it. It was fun and exciting rehearsing( 排练 ). He 18 the time
with other students. Then finally the big night came.
However, things felt 19 . The theater was full of people. He could hear the noises of
the audience. He looked around at other experienced actors and found the 20 they ’ d
shown at rehearsal seemed to have disappeared. Had they got their makeup right? What if they
forgot their lines? They talked about their 21 and the whole of the backstage area seemed
to be buzzing with tension and worry.
When, suddenly, Tom heard his cue(提示 ) and went on the stage. The lights were bright in his
eyes; he couldn ’ 22 t the audience but knew there were hundreds of people out there all
watching him. The 23 that had flowed so easily didn ’ t want to come and when they did he
found himself hurrying into them. He tried to 24 down his thoughts and his words but,
thinking about doing that, he suddenly realized he had 25 a sentence. What should he do?
Go back and start from the beginning? Try and add the sentence in where he was, or just
26 it and go on as though nothing had happened?
He chose to carry on, but when he finished and left the stage his hands felt sweaty and his
heart was racing. He didn ’ t think about what he had 27 —performing his first solo part in a
major production. Instead he was 28 himself up for the sentence that he ’ d missed.
The audience, of course, didn ’ know t he had missed a sentence. They made no sounds of
laughter at his 29 . His fellow actors, after the play had finished, were so busy talking
about their own performances that no one 30 on Tom ’ s missed sentenceapart from his drama teacher.
“ Well done, ” she said. “ Acting is a like learning to ride a bike. You may fall off a few times,
31 each time you get back on you do it better. Your performance may not have been
32 but, for your first time, it was great. ”
Tom felt 33 . It seemed like his teacher was saying it is okay to learn. You don ’ t
to be perfect, especially when you start something 34 .
Tom caught the look of his face in a mirror. It was smiling back at him with a sense of
35 . He looked at his face smiling back at him and raised two hands with his thumbs up.
